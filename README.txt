We'd also like to reference and credit Erik Anderson as a contributor.  he assisted us with form submission, internal storage writing, and app build prepping.

Our form submission code came from https://jsfiddle.net/seamusleahy/rxeuaatw/;

Our 2 bootstrap components that use JS are on the "trial" page.  One is used for a toast message that appears 5 seconds after the page
loads in the red aside bar, it will then vanish after 25 seconds.  The other uses the drop down
in the form, it takes the selected value and populates the input field above it.
